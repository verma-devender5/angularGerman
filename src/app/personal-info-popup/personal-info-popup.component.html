   evelop across all platforms
   Learn one way to build applications with Angular and reuse your code and abilities to build apps for any
   deployment target. For web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop.

   Speed & Performance
   Achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform today, and take it further, via Web Workers and
   server-side rendering. Angular puts you in control over scalability. Meet huge data requirements by building data
   models on RxJS, Immutable.js or another push-model.

   Incredible tooling
   Build features quickly with simple, declarative templates. Extend the template language with your own components
   and use a wide array of existing components. Get immediate Angular-specific help and feedback with nearly every
   IDE and editor. All this comes together so you can focus on building amazing apps rather than trying to make the
   code work.

   Loved by millions
   From prototype through global deployment, Angular delivers the productivity and scalable infrastructure that
   supports Google's largest applications.
